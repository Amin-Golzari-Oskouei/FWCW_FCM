# FWCW_FCM: New fuzzy C-means clustering method based on feature-weight and cluster-weight learning

This repository includes the MATLAB implementation of the FWCW_FCM algorithm presented in:

M. Hashemzadeh, A. G. Oskouei, and N. Farajzadeh, "New fuzzy C-means clustering method based on feature-weight and cluster-weight learning" 

Comments are written for all algorithm steps to better understand the code. Also, a demo is implemented for easy running, which runs by importing the data and other necessary algorithm parameters.
